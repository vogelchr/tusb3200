The tusb3200 is a USB1.1 controller used to build USB/audio interfaces.

It can send or receive data to or from up to 4 I²S audio DAC/ADCs or a AC97
codec. For this it runs a 8051 microcontroller core that configures the
USB engine which more-or-less takes care of the data-transport internally.

Firmware is stored in a external I2C eeprom and prefixed with a short header
explained in the tusb3200 data sheet:

	OFFSET	TYPE		SIZE	VALUE

	0	Signature	4	0x04513200

	4	Header	size	1	Header	size

	5	Version		1	Firmware	version

	6	EEPROM	type	1	0x01	=	Reserved
			0x02	=	Reserved
			0x03	=	Reserved
			0x04	=	Reserved
			0x05	=	Reserved
			0x06	=	Reserved
			0x07	=	Reserved
			0x08	=	Reserved
			0x09	=	24C32
			0x0A	=	24C64
			0x0B...0xFF	Reserved

	7	Data type           1  0x01 = Application code
		0x02...0xFF	= Reserved

	8	Data size           2  Data payload only size

	10	Check sum           2  Check sum of the data payload

	12	Data                -  Data payload

Attached python script converts from raw firmware to the header-prefixed
format stored in the eeprom.

For storing data in the eeprom (or dumping the eprom) the
small eeprog utility is very useful:

	eprog /dev/i2c-N 0x50 -r 0:8192 >dumpfile.bin
